# Analysis of Cerebrospinal Fluid Flow with Python

This is an analysis of the flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the cervicothoracic spine via the measurement of flow over 2.5 second intervals using TimeSTAMP MRI. MRI images were captured in the sagittal plane, and then CSF flow was hand-measured in Horos, a DICOM image viewing app. The subsequent flow measurements were then analyzed with Python, and a pattern of CSF flow emerged.

In this repository are the Jupyter notebooks (just Python code), which show the analyses of the hand measurements of CSF flow. This research was submitted to the American Journal of Neuroradiology (AJNR) on 2025-08-15, titled "Bulk Flow of Cerebrospinal Fluid in the Cervicothoracic Spine."
